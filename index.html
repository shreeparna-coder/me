    <p> Well yes, that is true. I am a 13 year old, struggling to get things to go my way. I am in 8th grade, DPS dwarka. I got plenty friends, and let's say I am quite popular (not so much though). I have fun class and a day in school seems short.... Weekends seem to take years to go by. Well I have a small group of 5 friends, including me. The most savage, cheerful and active people of the class. I love to eat, watch tv, sleep and repeat. Yep, everything a lazy teen does. I don't have any specific hobbies as such. I do whatever comes to my mind. Now whether that be dancing, drawing, coding, I mean there are a lot of possibilities.

        The only thing I do best and love to do is listening to my heart (I mean I do use my mind too but y'all know...). Sometimes you can see me going absolutely crazy. This includes talking to non-living objects, writing random songs on a paper, walking out in middle of a conversation and numerous other things. But crazy also means I can do real good pranks and most of them are pretending based. I mean I'm the best actor the class.
        
        <br> <br> Well let's talk about talents. I dance well, speak well, study well, run well, think well, and (very rarely) sing well. Ooh my hands ached typing all that well. What else? I don't know... I don't think I'd like to share anything else in this way so see y'all soon or sometime....
